# password-checker
 Check if your password has ever been hacked.
 
Run the password.py Python script to check if your password has been hacked.
 
This is a more secure way to check the security level of your password. Your password is not sent to the API server and only a partial segment of SHA-1 hash code version of the password is sent to the 3rd party API (haveibeenpwned.com/)
